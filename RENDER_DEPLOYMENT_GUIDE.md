# üöÄ Deploy Backend to Render - Step by Step Guide

## CRITICAL: Why Backend Deployment is REQUIRED

Your frontend is showing errors because:
- ‚ùå Backend is NOT deployed yet
- ‚ùå Frontend is trying to connect to `http://localhost:8000` (doesn't exist in production)
- ‚ùå No database connection = users can't sign up/login
